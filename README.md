# 2D Visual Honey Levels Minecraft Resourcepack
This work is licensed under CC-BY, please see LICENCE.txt for more information.\
This resourcepack changes the minecraft beehive and bee nest textures to show their honey level in your inventory, when you use silk touch on one.\
It is intended to be used in conjunction with the [2D block items resourcepack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/2d-block-items/) by ThePotatoKing55.\
It is also designed to work alongside the [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/) Visual Honey Stages resourcepack (under utility)
This pack requires the [CIT Resewn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cit-resewn) mod for Fabric.
It will not work with Optifine, as I do not support it, however feel free to port it yourself!
Enjoy!
